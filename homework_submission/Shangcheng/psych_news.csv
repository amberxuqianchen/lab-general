 2023",https://psych.ucsb.edu/news-events/news/2023/research-physical-activity-and-relationships-pbs-grad-student-paige-harris,"Research by PBS Graduate student Paige Harris & Prof. Nancy Collin’s on how physical activity and sports may impact romantic relationships and friendships was recently featured in the Current.
For her dissertation research, Paige Harris asks an important question:  “Given that physical activity promotes individual health and well-being, can it also help people develop happier and healthier close relationships?” Physical activity restores emotional, cognitive and physiological resources that may enable individuals to engage in pro-relationship behaviors, thereby improving relationship and social outcomes. Her dissertation work, which  received a National Institute of Social Sciences dissertation award for 2023, seeks to further develop this theoretical framework.   Paige conducts her work in Professor Nancy Collins' Close Relationships Lab, which examines why certain people are better able to cultivate secure and well-functioning relationships, and precisely how these relationships help people thrive using behavioral and psychophysiological methods.

 2023",https://psych.ucsb.edu/news-events/news/2023/pbs-grad-alisa-bedrovs-research-secrecy-highlighted-forbes-article,"A new study authored by PBS graduate student Alisa Bedrov and PBS Professor and Chair Dr. Shelly Gable on the intrapersonal and interpersonal impact of secrecy was recently highlighted by Forbes. Their study, published in the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, identified several key factors that determine the burden of a secret and the toll that keeping it might take on an individual, including daily personal impact, relationship impact, the pressure one feels to reveal their secret, as well as the anticipated consequences of revealing it. This exciting new work, conducted in Gable’s Emotions, Motivation, Behavior and Relationships Lab (The EMBeR lab), was the first to standardize a secrecy burden metric and to apply it to real-world secrets and well-being outcomes.
Congratulations, Alisa and Shelly!

"PBS professor René Weber finds that moral reasoning displays characteristic patterns in the brain, with distinctions between moral categories","Sep

Every day we encounter circumstances we consider wrong: a starving child, a corrupt politician, an unfaithful partner, a fraudulent scientist. These examples highlight several moral issues, including matters of care, fairness and betrayal. But does anything unite them all?
Philosophers, psychologists and neuroscientists have passionately argued whether moral judgments share something distinctive that separates them from non-moral matters. Moral monists claim that morality is unified by a common characteristic and that all moral issues involve concerns about harm. Pluralists, in contrast, argue that moral judgments are more diverse in nature.
Fascinated by this centuries-old debate, a team of researchers set out to probe the nature of morality using one of moral psychology’s most prolific theories. The group, led by UC Santa Barbara’s Rene Weber intensively studied 64 individuals via surveys, interviews and brain imaging on the wrongness of various behaviors.

 2023",https://psych.ucsb.edu/news-events/news/2023/platform-measure-and-track-inclusion-pioneered-pbs-professor-rene-weber,"PBS and Dept of Communication Prof. René Weber’s ongoing research on diversity and inclusion on social media has been recently featured by The Current. Dr Weber’s team recently investigated diversity, equity and inclusion in content produced by the media giant Snapchat. To do this tracking, they used the Measuring and Tracking Inclusion Platform (MTI), developed by Dr. Weber’s team at the UCSB Media Neuroscience Lab. The MTI platform combines human coding and computer-assisted techniques to enhance the reliability, efficiency, and accessibility of inclusion research. In their work, Dr. Weber’s team trained human coders to annotate gender, race, ethnicity, disability and LGBTQ identity in 300 shows featuring original content with 63 hosts and 726 speaking characters. They also integrated a bespoke computer vision system into the platform to analyze over 16,000 unique Snap stories randomly selected from content provided to the researchers by the company. Weber and team designed their protocol based on the expertise developed by their co-investigators at the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative. “It’s state of the art technology” said Malik, a graduate student in Dr. Weber’s lab “As far as we know, nobody else has implemented a system like ours anywhere.” MTI’s fully automated function can efficiently code massive content data sets, and includes a way to automatically track annotators’ reliability.

Asst. Prof Regina Lapate awarded prestigious NIH grant to elucidate prefrontal mechanisms of emotional processing and regulation,"Jul

 2023",https://psych.ucsb.edu/news-events/news/2023/asst-prof-regina-lapate-awarded-prestigious-nih-grant-elucidate-prefrontal,"Psychological & Brain Sciences Assistant Professor Regina Lapate was awarded a $2.3m grant from the National Institute of Mental Health to study the organization and function of the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) in emotional processing and regulation. Emotion regulation deficits are a hallmark of mood and anxiety disorders, which afflict over 20% of adults in the United States. Poor emotion regulation is often characterized by the context-inappropriate expression of emotion, including the unwarranted persistence and influence of negative states outside their temporal context. With the support of this award, Dr. Lapate’s team (the LEAP Neuro lab) will test a model of lateral prefrontal organization that postulates that affective and temporally extended information are integrated in the most anterior portion of LPFC–the lateral frontal pole–to inform context-sensitive affective responding via downstream function of a posterior LPFC region, the mid-LPFC. To that end, this work will combine advanced multivariate analysis of fMRI data and individualized (participant-tailored) causal methods (transcranial magnetic stimulation/TMS) to establish the functional and representational specificity of distinct prefrontal regions in emotion. Ultimately, this work will help advance a theoretical model of how prefrontal function may support adaptive time-and-context appropriate responses in the face of emotional challenges.
Congratulations, Dr. Lapate!"
