## Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through the process of installing Anaconda, Python, Git and VS Code on your Mac.

- GitHub: A web-based platform that hosts the project files and provides collaboration features.
- Git: A version control system that allows you to download the project files and keep track of changes.
- Anaconda: A distribution of Python and R programming languages for scientific computing.
- VS Code: A code editor that provides syntax highlighting, debugging, and other features.
