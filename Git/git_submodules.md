# Best Practices for Using Git Submodules to Manage Dependencies in a Git Repository

Git submodules are a way to include one Git repository as a subdirectory of another Git repository. This can be useful for managing dependencies in a Git repository. Here are some best practices to follow when using Git submodules to manage dependencies in a Git repository:

- **Identify dependencies:** Identify the dependencies that need to be managed using Git submodules

- **Create a submodule:** Create a submodule by running the command `git submodule add <repository>`

- **Update submodules:** Update submodules by running the command `git submodule update`

- **Commit changes:** Commit changes to the parent repository and the submodule repository separately

Remember to always save your work and commit changes frequently to avoid losing progress. Good luck with your research!
