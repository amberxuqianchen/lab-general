Here are the key points for using Git and GitHub effectively in psychology research:

- Create a new repository for your project
- Commit changes frequently to save your work
- Use Gitignore files to exclude unnecessary files and directories
- Troubleshoot issues using Git status, log, diff, revert, stash, reset, abort merge, and rebase
- Use additional resources and support, such as GitHub Guides, Git documentation, GitHub Help, Stack Overflow, and GitHub Education

Remember to always save your work and commit changes frequently to avoid losing progress. Good luck with your research!
