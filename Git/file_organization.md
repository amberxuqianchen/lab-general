# Best Practices for Organizing Files and Folders When Using Git and GitHub for Version Control in Psychology Research

When using Git and GitHub for version control in psychology research, it is important to organize your files and folders in a way that makes sense and is easy to navigate. Here are some best practices to follow:

- **Create a clear folder structure:** Create a clear folder structure that reflects the organization of your research project, and that makes it easy to find and access files

- **Use descriptive file names:** Use descriptive file names that accurately reflect the content of the file, and that make it easy to find and access files

- **Use subfolders:** Use subfolders to organize related files together, and to keep your main folder structure clean and easy to navigate

- **Use Gitignore files:** Use Gitignore files to exclude files and folders that do not need to be tracked by Git, such as data files or temporary files

Remember to always save your work and commit changes frequently to avoid losing progress. Good luck with your research!
