# Best Practices for Writing Clear Commit Messages When Using Git and GitHub for Version Control in Psychology Research

When using Git and GitHub for version control in psychology research, it is important to write clear and descriptive commit messages that accurately reflect the changes made in the commit. Here are some best practices to follow:

- **Use present tense:** Use present tense to describe what the commit does, not what it did

- **Be specific:** Be specific about what changes were made in the commit, and why they were made

- **Keep it short:** Keep commit messages short and to the point, while still providing enough information to understand the changes made

- **Use the imperative mood:** Use the imperative mood to give commands, such as "Add", "Update", or "Fix"

Remember to always save your work and commit changes frequently to avoid losing progress. Good luck with your research!
